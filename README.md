# cli-agenda

--- UNFINISHED 2/3/24 ---

I created a CLI task tracker/agenda because I have a knack for not writing things down. So, instead of doing my actual classwork right now, I decided to make an application to help me do classwork in the future! 

Application writes and reads from a .txt file that holds a 'task.' Task attributes include course #, due date, and assignment name. Different commands can be input by the user, these being: List, Add, Archive, and Exit (exits the program). Sweet and simple personal project I decided to work on in my free time. Uses time.h library.

# List

# Add

# Archive

# Exit
Exits the program.
